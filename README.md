1) Create a folter in your C drive, name it EventHub (optional)

2) Download the repo and copy all the files in the created folder "EventHub"

2) Open a command prompt in the project's root directory (EventHub)

3) Type: `npm install`
    This installs the dependencies as defined in the package.json file.
    
4) Open the project folder with VCSCODE.
    
5) After installing all the packages in the cmd, Type: `npm start`
    This launches the TypeScript compiler (tsc) to compile the application and wait for changes. 
    It also starts the lite-server and launches the browser to run the application.
